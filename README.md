## This application is a simple text-based game writted in Python.

### Game Description:
You are the commander of a small group of elite trained soldiers that have been cut off from your main force and are low on ammunition and supplies. There is a large enemy ground force stationed on the battlefield nearby that you will have to defeat blocking your path to the friendly forces. Under the cover of night, your team needs to move quickly and quietly throughout the area to gather supplies to be strong enough to fight the enemy force. Should your forces not retrieve all the supplies, they will direly be outnumbered and outgunned by the enemy. To win, you will need to move your troops and retrieve equipment laid around the battlefield following the most recent force on force conflict. 

Your forces are currently hidden in a tree line to the Northwest of the enemy ground force. In the area your team will gather grenades from the bunker to keep the enemy at a distance, enemy intelligence in the burned HQ to know their formations and fighting patterns, body armor from the abandoned warehouse that will protect your team, two tanks in the cargo bay to provide your troops extra firepower and cover, ammunition in the supply depot to refill ammunition, and food and water in the residential area to keep your troops in good fighting condition. 

### Directions:
You will have to memorize the layout of the map, it does not change between game instances. Move to new or previously visited locations by typing "go X" where X represents North, South, East, or West. If the room you are currently in has supplies, it will prompt you accordingly. You can pick up the supplies by typing "Get X" where X represents the name of the item. If you attempt to move out of bounds, your position will not change.

### Challenge:
What is the lowest amount of moves necessary to beat the game?
